I, Ghostise, acting in full power of my command as Grandmaster of the April Knights, ordain this charter for the April Knights.

Our Order was founded in the days of the Button as a force of balance and a beacon of hope. We strive to spread the glory of our Order far and wide, to unite the people of Reddit towards a common goal, and to oppose the evil forces of chaos that seek to ruin the fun of the April Events.

The panel is not only responsible for determining if the officer is impeached or not, but if the accusations warrant a punishment less severe than impeachment. Should the officer in question be impeached, the panel is also responsible for deciding said officer’s standing with the April Knights.
