# Battalion Standardization Act
The battalion is the core organizational unit of the April Knights. They are the tools that the Grandmaster uses for planning, and their quality is the utmost importance for the collective success of the Order. This act is to set maximums on the amount of members a battalion can have and how many sergeants should be in each battalion.

### Section I
A battalion is not to exceed one hundred (100) members. The make up of a battalion will consist of one (1) Commander, up to nine (9) Sergeants, and up to ninety (90) Oathsworn Knights.

### Section II
Of the nine (9) Sergeants in each battalion, one of the Sergeants will be the “First Sergeant”. These should be the most experienced to help the battalion Commander and assist them in their duties. The First Sergeant does not out rank the other Sergeants, but is the first among equals.

### Section III
All battalions fall under the supremacy of the Grandmaster and the authority of the Councils, of which all Commanders are a member. Commanders who fail to recognize the supremacy and authority of either the Grandmaster or both of the Councils are guilty of insubordination and should be removed from their position of command.

### Section IV
This act shall take effect as soon as voted and approved by both Councils, and confirmed by the Grandmaster.
