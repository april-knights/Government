# Legislative Procedure
Providing the Knights with a clear and simple process for creating and voting on legislation.

## Article I - Proposing Legislation
### Section I
When crafting some hopeful legislation, remember that the Articles of Governance are the code of **how** governing works within the April Knights. And that Legislation provides the additional context about the changes where appropriate. Where commentary is useful to the application of "the articles", that commentary should be added within the articles themselves. All other parts of an act that aren't specifically about how governing is done should go within a separate legislative act.

As a rule of thumb, legislation should have titles at heading level 1, articles at heading level 2, and sections at heading level 3.

### Section II
The author of some hopeful legislation typically shares the working version of the legislation among the Lower Council and/or Upper Council prior to formally introducing it as a proposed bill. This is to gain feedback that may be extremely useful.

### Section III
When the author of some hopeful legislation feels that it is ready to be formally proposed, they should contact the Grandmaster or First Ranger who will assign a bill number and announce it within the Conclave.

The method used to identify proposed bills shall utilize a two item identifier, “X-TYY”.

1. “X” is the number of the current Grandmaster.
    1. “X” will only change when a Grandmaster is not re-elected and the position shifts to a new individual.
1. “T” is the term number of the Grandmaster.
1. “YY” is the bill number assigned to it.
    1. "YY" is "zero-padded", so if “Y” is a single digit, it will have a zero (0) placed in front of it.
    1. "YY" increments by one (1) for each proposed bill, including those which fail or are withdrawn.
1. Upon the end of term for any Grandmaster, “YY” will reset down to one.

Examples:

1. The first bill during Grandmaster 7’s first term would be 7-101 and the first bill during their second term would be 7-201.
1. The first bill during Grandmaster 8's first term would then be 8-101 and the next proposed bill during their first term would be 8-102.

## Article II - Voting
### Section I
Changes to proposed Legislation are permitted during the period after its submission to the Council considering it, whether in private Council chambers, or in the public Conclave. There is a minimum of two weeks for a piece of legislation to be officially proposed before it can be voted on. In the course of debate, changes or edits are permitted until one week before the voting period begins. Should it be required that changes be made during the last week leading up to the vote, the vote must be rescheduled so that another week may pass for public visibility. As outlined in the Constitution, the timing and scheduling limitations may be waived during an April event.   See Appendix 1 for workflow.

### Section II
1. The Grandmaster should schedule a vote for legislation, waiting at least 2 weeks for public viewing. The Grandmaster should also ensure all battalion representatives are notified of the scheduled date of the vote.
1. The voting period will last exactly 48 hours from the selected starting time of the vote or until every representative has voted, whichever comes first. All votes will be counted; any representative that fails to vote either Aye or Nay will be counted as an abstention. During the tally, should the vote counts clearly show either passage or rejection, the result may be published while not ending the vote early.

### Section III
During the 48 hour voting period, no comments, arguments, or qualifiers will be permitted regarding the legislation being voted on. The time of the first introduction and the 2 weeks of it under public review, to any time afterwards is where such action is permitted.

### Section IV
All council members are to behave civilly and treat each other with respect worthy of all oathsworn Knights.

### Section V
1. If any member of either council is found to be in violation of this act, the Arbiters or a majority of the Triad have the full power to suspend any representative from partaking in as many sessions as they deem necessary.
1. The Grandmaster can bypass any suspension issued in this manner. When this happens the Grandmaster shall inform the Arbiters, the Triad, or both of this.
