# Mediation Act

If a Knight is accused of unsavoury behaviour by any member of the April Knights discord, all actions must be taken to address the alleged behaviour in a fair manner. This law recognises that these situations can often be resolved with communication, rather than by trial or severe consequence. This Act recognises that these situations can be complicated, and that multiple perspectives and feelings can be involved. The purpose of this Act is not to define who an ‘unsavoury person’ is, but to acknowledge when there has been ‘unsavoury behaviour’ (see A1, SI) that has created a ‘negative impact’ (see A1, SII), and how to address this effectively. The aim of the legislation will be to outline steps that will encourage self-reflection and accountability, while promoting understanding and communication. Therefore, this law outlines what behaviour this Act is relevant to, the occasions in which a mediation may be called for, the appointment of the Moderation Committee, what will happen when more than one Knight is impacted by the behaviour, and what outcomes may be used to resolve the situation. It is hoped that this legislation may free-up the Grandmaster and Upper Council from having to directly deal with all disagreements or conflict.

## Article 1 - Definitions

### Section I - Unsavoury Behaviour

Unsavoury behaviour is not to be confused with more severe behaviour, such as harassment (e.g. threats, derogatory comments based on gender or race), sharing inappropriate content (e.g. NSFW, explicit images etc.), or invading privacy (e.g. doxing). Unsavoury behaviour is behaviour that is less severe in nature, in which it does not need to be met with immediate repercussions. However, the behaviour still needs to be addressed due to its negative impact on the Knights as a whole, or the negative impact on the wellbeing of individual Knights.

Unsavoury Behaviour may include any of the following behaviours (Please note: This list is not exhaustive):

* Bullying: persistent teasing, mocking, belittling of other members.
* Spamming: Posting excessive irrelevant or repetitive content (links, images, messages).
* Trolling: Intentionally provoking or antagonising other members with inflammatory remarks.
* Disruptive Behaviour: Intentionally derailing discussions, or disrupting conversations occurring via text channels or on voice chat.
* Ignoring rules: Intentionally ignoring or going against April Knights/Discord Server rules, guidelines, or direct instructions regarding their behaviour (from a Knight of a higher rank).
* Unfair Treatment: A Knight with power over another member, who is providing unwarranted discipline, criticism, or instruction to their subordinate (e.g. a superior, such as a Commander unfairly treating a First Officer).
* Disrespectful Behaviour: Using disrespectful language which may alienate members or contribute to a negative atmosphere (e.g. excessive swearing, sarcasm, gaslighting, passive-aggressive remarks).
* Arguing: Respectful debate or disagreement is welcome by the April Knights. Debate and disagreement turn to arguing when a person persistently ignores or dismisses other participants views, constantly pushes their agenda, uses fallacious arguments (mistaken beliefs as facts), or becomes accusatory towards those with opposing views.
* False Accusations: Purposefully making negative false claims about others, inflammatory finger pointing, starting rumours, or insinuating others intentions are nefarious without proof.

If you are unsure of whether the behaviour is considered to be ‘unsavoury’, please see ‘Article 1, *Section II - Negative Impact’*.

### Section II - Negative Impact

There may be times when behaviour is on the borderline of ‘unsavoury’. In these circumstances, it is worth looking at the overall impact the behaviour is having on either the Knights as a whole, or an individual Knight experiencing the behaviour. For this reason, ‘Negative Impact’ has been defined below. The list below is not exhaustive, and should be used as a guide only.

It is worth noting that some April Knights members have either in-person or external online relationships. The April Knights may consider the behaviour as still impacting the April Knights as a whole, or an individual member of the April Knights, if the external interaction is in relation to April Knights matters (e.g. discussing a debate in person as it occurs in the April Knights discord server).

It is also worth noting that more than one party can feel the behaviour of others has negatively impacted them in some way. This can include a person accused of unsavoury behaviour also accusing others of using unsavoury behaviour. In these cases, the impact should be considered for all parties involved (see *Article 3, Section II, b - Lead Mediator Discretion*).

A behaviour may be considered ‘unsavoury’ if any of the following negative impacts on the April Knights as a whole, or directly to an April Knight member, occurs:

* An individual or certain group of people feel alienated or targeted by the behaviour.
* The behaviour is repeatedly found to be annoying or frustrating.
* An individual or a group of people feel hurt by the behaviour.
* The behaviour has created or contributed to a negative atmosphere.
* An individual or group of people feel ridiculed, unsupported, unwanted, or unheard.
* An individual or group of people feel a sense of helplessness in their experience of the behaviour.
* An individual or group of people feel uncomfortable as a result of the behaviour.

### Section III - Notifiers

From henceforth, any Knights who identify unsavoury behaviour or have been impacted by unsavoury behaviour will be referred to as ‘Notifier/s’.

### Section IV - Accused

From henceforth, any Knights who are identified as using unsavoury behaviour will be referred to as ‘Accused’.

## Article 2 - Moderation Committee

### Section I - Formation of the Moderation Committee

A Moderation Committee shall be constituted, comprising a minimum of three (3) and maximum of five (5) distinguished Knights of an Officer Rank. The Moderation Committee shall be formed immediately after this bill is established, as outlined in Article 4, and re-formed after each election as per the *Appointment Process* outlined in Article 2, Selection III.

### Section II - Selection Criteria for Committee Members

1. Committee Members must not have been a part of any mediation as either Accused or Notifier in the past twelve (12) months.
2. They must be able to commit to being fully impartial, and be able to recognise when they may be biassed. In the case of personal bias, they must be willing to hand over mediation duties to another member on the Committee.
3. They must have been active within the April Knights during the last twelve (12) months, including the preceding campaign.
4. To ensure this Act upholds the intention of reducing Grandmaster and Upper Council member involvement in minor conflict, these Officers must not currently occupy a seat on the Upper Council. However, due to an Advisors role on the Upper Council, and lack of division related responsibilities, a maximum of one (1) Advisor may be permitted to be a member on the Moderation Committee if required.
5. They must willingly accept the nomination.

### Section III - Appointment Process

After the transitions of power between Grandmasters, and after the appointment of both Councils, a Moderation Committee shall be chosen. A minimum of three (3) and maximum of five (5) Knights shall be nominated within fourteen (14) days after inauguration of a Grandmaster.

1. Once the role of Moderation Committee member is accepted, Committee members will be sworn in by a simple majority vote of both councils.
2. Once sworn in, Moderation Committee members shall serve until the next committee is nominated and sworn in.
3. Moderation Committee members will be added to the #ModerationTicket channel recipients.
4. If the Grandmaster or members of the Councils decide, at any point, that a member of the Moderation Committee is unfit to mediate properly, whether from inactivity, bias, or any other reason, they are empowered to remove the offending members from the Moderation Committee via absolute majority vote of both councils.

### Section IV - Moderation Committee Responsibilities

Once chosen and sworn in, the Moderation Committee shall be the main body responsible for the mediation of disputes, as outlined in Article 3. The Upper Council may bestow upon them any permissions or roles required to do their responsibilities effectively. Mediators will have the following roles, responsibilities and powers:

1. Keep the mediation procedure moving as swiftly as possible. In doing so, they treat all parties respectfully, and provide equal offerings of support to all members of the mediation process. They prompt Notifiers and the Accused to write their statements, support Notifiers to come to a decision about what they need from the Accused (what outcome they want from mediation), etc. They support the Accused to consider what outcome would be appropriate based on their behaviour. However, mediators are not to push for certain outcomes or try to sway either party in a particular direction.
2. Collect all statements from all parties and determine the best way of sharing them to all parties.
3. Promote reflection and communication, rather than finger pointing. Remind all parties that the purpose of mediation is not to determine if a person has acted unsavoury, but to recognise that the behaviour had an impact and to find a way to move forward. Ask questions that open conversation.
4. Providing guidance on how to proceed with mediation discussions, once all statements are received. The mediator is not there to control the conversation, but as an unbiased guide and supporter to all parties.
5. The Lead Mediator may decide that mediation is not the best course of action. For example, mediation may be ended if any parties participate in unhelpful discussion or unsavoury behaviour. If mediation has not resolved the matter within seven days after mediation has been announced, mediation should be ended. If mediation is not successful, the Lead and any supporting mediators can report back to the Upper Council with any recommendations on consequences or next steps (see A3, SII: *Unsuccessful Mediation*).

## Article 3 - Procedure

This Act recognises that the expectation of all members of the April Knights Discord will promptly and respectfully call out unsavoury behaviour. If attempts at resolving the issue in-the-moment are unsuccessful, then the Mediation procedure can begin.

### Section I - Mediation Preparation

#### *a) Security Considerations*

Before mediation is conducted, if the Grandmaster or the Grand Inquisitor determine that a security risk warrants such actions, a Knight accused may have their privileges temporarily revoked. These may include access to any and all Knight exclusive communication channels. The temporary nature of this preemptive action must be made clear to the accused and any who may witness this. Actions taken for security purposes should not imply unproven guilt.

#### *b) Identifying the Impacted Parties*

In the case that mediation is required, a Moderation Committee Member will announce that mediation is required, either:

1. The Moderation Committee Member may address the behaviour privately via DM if there is a singular Knight impacted by the behaviour.
2. The Moderation Committee Member may assume that more than one Knight has been impacted if the written conduct has occurred in a channel where multiple Knights can read it. Therefore, the Moderation Committee Member may address the behaviour ‘publicly’ if it has occurred in a ‘public’ or ‘Knight-only’ discord channel, including those channels limited to set Knight Roles (e.g. #Lower Council).

The Moderation Committee Member will ask all negatively impacted parties to contact them privately via DM, to announce their desire to be a part of mediation. If the Moderation Committee Member does not have the availability to take on this task, they may ask all negatively impacted parties to use the ‘#ModerationTicket’ channel instead. All members who feel they have been negatively impacted are given twenty-four (24) hours to request to be a participant of mediation.

At the end of a twenty-four (24) hour period, the Moderation Committee Member will tally up the number of Notifiers. The Accused Knight will be informed of how many Notifiers will be partaking, and will be given relevant updates on progress and procedure in the lead up to mediation.

#### *c) Appointment of the Lead Mediator*

All Notifiers and Accused must identify their preferences of who they would like to preside over the mediation process as ‘Lead Mediator’ (i.e. identify one or more mediators they believe will be unbiased). AND any mediators they believe would be inappropriate to partake as mediator for this circumstance (Lead or otherwise), with justification. To avoid delays, the Moderation Committee may request this information be provided by Notifiers at the time of identifying themselves as a mediation participant. All attempts should be made to appoint a Lead Mediator within Forty-Eight (48) hours of a mediation announcement.

In the first instance, mediators who have been identified as a preference (excluding any identified as inappropriate with justifiable reasons) will determine whether they are capable of taking on the task of mediator, using the below indicators of suitability. If those with a preference are not suitable, mediators who are neither excluded or preferred will determine whether they are capable of taking on the task of mediator, using the below indicators of suitability.

##### Indicators of Suitability

1. Does not identify themselves as negatively impacted by the Accused's behaviour, regardless of whether they decided to participate in the mediation process as a Notifier or not.
2. To the best of their ability, they believe they can remain impartial and unbiased throughout the mediation process.
3. They have the time and capacity to begin mediation within a maximum of three (3) days, and the availability to respond to mediation within the seven (7) days after mediation has been announced (Or two to three (2-3) mediators are chosen that can provide this coverage so that matters are resolved quickly).
4. They continue to uphold the eligibility requirements to become a Moderation Committee Member.

In the rare instance that no Moderation Committee Members are suitable, please see *Lead Mediator Discretions *(A3, SII, b, IX)*. *

### Section II - Mediation Tools and Process

#### *a) Statement Templates*

In the interest of resolving matters quickly, the below statement templates are supplied to prompt self-reflection, to be used by all parties (i.e. Notifiers and Accused). Statements can be provided from the moment an Accused or Notifier is identified. The prompts used in the below template are to encourage open communication, accountability, perspective taking, and understanding in order to facilitate all parties feeling heard and understood. They are NOT used to determine if someone did or did not act in an unsavoury manner. The goal is not to point fingers, but to reach an understanding and agreement on how to move forward.

1. What outcome do you wish to achieve / would be willing to accept by the end of this mediation?
2. What do you need or want from the other parties involved in this mediation?
3. Reflecting on what happened, how would you like things to be handled differently in future (including how you could have done things differently)?
4. Is there anything you would like to add on how this situation may have impacted you?

#### *b) Lead Mediator Discretion*

As seen in *Moderation Committee Responsibilities *(A2, SIV), mediators are given a great deal of discretion over how mediation may proceed. This Act recognises that a number of unexpected situations may arise during conflict or mediation procedures. This Act does not have the ability to lay out the process for every unique situation. However, the following information provides clarification and guidance around likely decisions a Mediator will need to make about how to proceed during mediation.

1. The mediator may utilise private threads or channels to conduct proceedings. Either for all of the Notifiers OR all of the Accused, to have joint discussions regarding outcomes (in the event that there is more than one (1) Notifier or Accused), or for the mediation process to occur between Notifier/s and Accused. Alternatively, mediators could be the middle person that goes back and forth between different parties, by contacting individual participants via DMs.
2. The mediator may take an observational standpoint unless they are needed to intervene or prompt proceedings. The mediator may also prompt turn-taking, if they feel this will make the mediation process go more quickly or smoothly.
3. The mediator may decide whether individual or group statements may be used if there is more than one (1) Notifier or Accused.
4. The Lead Mediator has the ability to decide whether sharing the Accused’s statement with the Notifiers early (i.e. prior to receiving all Notifier statements) will encourage a quicker end to mediation.
5. In the event that there is confusion over who should be identified as a Notifier or an Accused, the mediator may discard all titles (i.e. refer to all parties equally as participants and avoid any ‘Notifier’ or ‘Accused’ private channels), or use known evidence to determine which party the individual most fits with.
6. With consultation from the Upper Council, the Moderation Committee may decide whether it is purposeful to share the outcome of the mediation in a public way (e.g. within the channel where the behaviour originally occurred).
7. Members of the Upper and Lower Council are expected to represent the ethos of the April Knights, and so any who partake in unsavoury behaviour may be considered as impacting the April Knights as a whole. Therefore, the Lead Mediator may request that the Grandmaster or Grand Inquisitor identify themselves as a Notifier in the event that a member of the Upper or Lower Council member is identified as an Accused. This will be in the purpose of Grandmaster or Grand Inquisitor ensuring an appropriate outcome is reached in mediation. If the Grandmaster or Grand Inquisitor believes outcomes beyond what is suggested in *Successful Mediation *(A4, SI)* *is relevant, then the behaviour may be beyond what this Act is situated for.
8. The Lead Mediator may decide that the use of the aforementioned statement template (A3, SII, a) is counter-productive to proceedings, and elect for participants to use individualised statements or no statements, with justification.
9. If no members of the Moderation Committee are suitable for the mediation in question, the Moderation Committee may elect a Temporary Moderation Committee Member to become Lead Mediator for the duration of the seven (7) days of mediation. A Temporary Moderation Committee Member must meet the criteria as set out in *Appointment Process* (A2, SII) and indicators of suitability in *Appointment of the Lead mediator *(A3, SI, c).
10. The Moderation Committee may decide to remove observation (see A3, SII, d) or support person (see A3, SII, c) privileges if they negatively impact on proceedings.

Any decisions that need to be made outside of the above guidance should be made with consultation from impartial Moderation Committee members or impartial Upper Council Members.

#### *c) Support Persons*

As mediation’s purpose is to open communication and promote accountability, it would not be beneficial for any Notifier or Accused to have a ‘representative’, or someone who speaks on or formulates statements on their behalf. Traditionally, a support person’s role is to act as a semi-silent supportive bystander, meaning they might offer advice to an individual throughout mediation but otherwise do not talk on their behalf. Therefore, a support person may be a relevant role in mediation.

It is important to note, that the role of mediator is also in part to support Accused or Notifiers to self-reflect, and consider the outcomes they want from mediation. However, there may be certain circumstances where a support person could be helpful:

1. The number of Notifiers overwhelms the Accused.
2. A Notifier or Accused feels they need the support of someone directly, especially to resolve the issue in a timely manner.

In these cases, a support person must meet the following requirements:

1. They are not in a position that may influence the outcome of the mediation, whether they would intend to do this or not (e.g. as Lower and Upper Council members hold a position of power and can potentially sway others opinions unintentionally, they are not a suitable candidate for a support person).
2. They are not a Notifier, Accused, or member of the Moderation Committee themselves.
3. They agree to only contact the person they are supporting regarding the mediation directly.
4. They agree to uphold confidentiality of the mediation process.
5. They have the time and capacity to provide support during the seven (7) days after a mediation is announced.

#### *d) Mediation Observers*

Mediation observers should be kept to a minimum to ensure privacy of all parties involved. No observation thread should be made. Those who may view, but not participate in, any private mediation threads created could be:

1. The Grandmaster
2. The Grand Inquisitor
3. Members of the Moderation Committee that are impartial to the situation.
4. Support Persons

## Article 4 - Outcomes

### Section I - Successful Mediation

The outcome of mediation will depend on the negotiations between the Notifiers and the Accused. Since this Act deals in less-severe but still negatively impactful behaviour, the following outcomes may be appropriate:

1. An official apology and acknowledgement made privately or publicly.
2. A warning.
3. Public admonishment.
4. Temporary mute for some or all April Knight communication.
5. A temporary ban on succession/ promotion/ division acceptance for a period of six to twelve (6-12) months.
6. A temporary role-removal for a period of six to twelve (6-12) months. (e.g. Council Observer role or Builder status revoked).
7. Transfer to another battalion.
8. A step down from rank (including demotion from the Upper or Lower Council) with the possibility of reapplication after a set timeframe (a return to rank is never guaranteed).
9. A temporary exclusion of responsibilities (e.g. Unable to have a final say on Interview acceptance/denial for a period of six to twelve (6-12) months).

The above list is not exhaustive, and more than one outcome may be used to resolve the matter. Once the mediator identifies that proceedings have come to a resolution, the mediator may summarise the mediation process and confirm all parties are willing to mark the matter as resolved. The summary and outcome of the mediation will then be shared with Upper Council, and where appropriate, Lower Council Members (i.e. after non-private conflict).

### Section II - Unsuccessful Mediation

Mediation may be deemed ‘unsuccessful’ if:

1. Mediation remains unresolved after seven (7) days since mediation was announced. This remains valid even if mediation was delayed due to waiting for statements, or mediator availability. This Act aims to resolve small matters quickly. Extensions create unnecessary delays.
2. It is clear no resolution can be reached.
3. Mediators are finding it difficult to keep conversation civil or productive.
4. The unsavoury behaviour continues.

In this case, the mediator/s can advise the Upper Council on their observations and recommendations for next steps / outcomes. Outcomes may include any of the outcomes listed in *Successful Outcomes* (A4, SI). Or, the Upper Council may decide the behaviour in question needs more action. If the Upper Council believes further action than outlined in this Act is required, other procedures or legislation may need consultation (e.g. The Trials Act).

## Article 5 - Implementation

The Mediation Act will come into effect immediately after majority vote in the Upper and Lower council. Any changes to the Mediation act will be listed below for future reference.

### Section I - Version and Changes

The initial version of the act was proposed in March, 2024.

The following changes have been made since its initial acceptance and implementation:
