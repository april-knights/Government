# Governmental Documentation Empowerment Act
Providing the April Knights with efficient tools for managing the legislative process.

## Article I - Intent
The goal of this document empowerment act is to help the April Knights to be a lean and effective bureaucracy when it comes to governance.

It is too easy to keep adding and adding when you have good ideas for progress. But each addition typically makes it so that each further addition requires more work, even if only a little bit. Legislation that is passed should be separated from the Articles of Governance (or "code") that we follow as Knights in order to keep the articles of governance/code/policies bounded.

Where appropriate, legislation should add and remove content from the Articles of Governance rather than forever tacking on amendment sections to the articles. This legislation sets the framework for a future where dozens (or hundreds) of acts have been passed, but it is still easy as a knight to find and review all documents for **how** the governing works within the organization. The way this is accomplished is by separating the processes (Articles of Governance) from the context (Legislation).

## Article II - Method
There are three primary areas that have been changed as part of this act that will each be detailed further below.

1. Establish a version control system over the use of manual versioning.
1. Describe the relationship between Articles of Governance and Legislative Acts.
1. Clean up the current governmental documents.

### Section I - Version Control System over Versioning
Traditionally, every legislation has had to explicitly tag its release (e.g. Trials Act v1.1). This is in an effort to allow for the immutable and preserving retention of all passed acts (laws). It is time to use a proper version control system so that tagging each revision of a document is no longer necessary.

A version control system provides complete visibility into ALL versions of ALL documents within the repository. The only items that don't have have this would be things that aren't part of the repository: proposed bills. But there is already a system for uniquely identifying proposed bills found within the article of governance Document Standardization, so further versioning is not needed for proposed bills! Note that as part of this legislation, the Document Standardization is getting removed and will be merged into the Voting Procedures (which is also being renamed to Legislative Procedures so as to not be confused with Elections and the voting therein).

Where the April Knights previously had `Trials Act v1.0` or `Trials Act v1.1`, there now is just the article of governance on Trials. Anyone wishing to view, reference, download, or share the old versions of that article can do so natively within the employed version control system.

### Section II - Articles of Governance vs Legislation
As part of this act getting passed, it is formally recognized that the Articles of Governance and Legislation are two separate parts of the governing documents within the April Knights.

The Articles of Governance are the code of **how** governing works within the April Knights. The Legislation provides the additional context about the changes that is appropriate. Where commentary is useful to the application of "the articles", that commentary should be added within the articles themselves. All other parts of an act that aren't specifically about how governing is done should go within a legislative act.

### Section III - Document Standardization

1. Legislation related items added to the Legislative Procedures article (which was previously "Voting Procedures").
1. Clean up governmental documents to remove version numbers that are not needed, "enactment" clauses for things that are in effect and possibly have been in effect for several years, and other smaller formatting changes to make reading easier in markdown view.

## Article III - Version Control Rider
Because version control systems do not handle changes to file contents and file names at the same time well, if this act is passed, a 2nd commit would be done which renames the following:

* Voting Procedures
* Vindicator Maximus

This is entirely an administrative change that ensures that tracking documents through their entire history is easily accessible.
