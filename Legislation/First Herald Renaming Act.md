# First Herald Renaming Act

As the April Knights grow and change as an organization, roles can change in meaning over time, and this bill hopes to reflect that as well as make other minor changes to the role currently known as the First Steward.

In the past, the First Steward was the April Knights foremost diplomat and steward of the image of the realm, however during LadyVulcanâ€™s Grandmastership, their duties were changed to being the division leader of the Heralds, and as such, their name should reflect this change.

### Section I

All instances referring to the First Steward within legislation shall be changed to First Herald. Documents to be changed include:

* April Knights Constitution
* Trials
* Mutare Magia Act
* Vindicaris Maximus

In order to preserve the history of the Knights, one exception to the title renaming exists that shall not be changed: "First Steward Gryph", who is listed as the author of Vindicator Maximus.

### Section II

The Document Standardization Act shall also be changed to reflect that the First Herald shall choose the UC scribe and not the Grandmaster.

### Section III - Enactment

This bill will go into effect at the time in which it has been voted on and approved by both Councils.
