# First Herald Renaming Act

As the April Knights grow and change as an organization, roles can change in meaning over time, and this bill hopes to reflect that as well as make other minor changes to the role currently known as the First Steward.

In the past, the First Steward was our foremost diplomat and steward of the image of our realm, however during LadyVulcan’s Grandmastership, their duties were changed to being the division leader of the Heralds, and as such, their name should reflect this change.

This Knight will be known as the Scribe. The First Herald may choose themselves, and the Scribe duties outlined would fall on them during periods in which the Scribe position is unfilled. The Scribe position is not an Upper Council position."
